# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! 

I am Dani, and in April 2024 I decided that I will be going on the rewarding (and challenging) journey of teaching myself code. I am particularly interested in the prospect of becoming a full-stack developer. 

As you might have expected, I have started with the front-end frameworks and have thus far strengthened my knowledge in HTML and CSS and am now navigating the exciting language of JavaScript. 

I started with The Odin Project Fundamentals, but have found that it is not as in-depth as I would prefer. Thus, I went on the hunt to find something more up-my-alley...

I am currently learning through App Academy Open (Software Engineer), and though the course is difficult - I have truly been enjoying this journey and can not wait learn even more. 

Watch this space!
